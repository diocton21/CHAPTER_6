Flutter (Mobile app development)

USING COMMON WIDGETS

In this chapter, I got to explore some of the most commonly used basic widgets in Flutter—the essential building blocks for designing mobile apps. It felt like learning the tools I’ll use over and over in any app I create.

I started by looking at the different types of buttons and understanding when to use each one depending on the situation. Whether it’s a simple text button or a more styled elevated button, it’s all about picking what works best for the app’s functionality and design.

I also learned how to add assets to my app using the AssetBundle. By listing items in the pubspec.yaml file, I could include things like images, fonts, or other resources. Speaking of images, I experimented with the Image widget, which allows me to load pictures from the local device or even directly from a URL. It’s amazing how seamless it is to pull content from different sources.

For icons, the Icon widget came in handy. It uses the MaterialIcons font library, which means I can access a huge library of pre-designed icons to enhance the app’s user interface.

To customize the look of widgets, I worked with BoxDecoration. It’s such a flexible tool for tweaking backgrounds, borders, and shadows, giving widgets a polished appearance. I also
learned about InputDecoration, which is great for improving how users interact with text fields.


One of the highlights was learning how to validate text fields. By using the Form widget, I can handle multiple input validations in a clean and efficient way, whether I want to do it manually or automatically.


Lastly, I explored MediaQuery, which helps determine the device’s current orientation. This is super powerful because it lets me adjust the layout of my widgets depending on whether the device is in portrait or landscape mode. It’s small details like these that can make an app feel much more user-friendly.

In the next chapter, I’ll start working with animations. I’ll begin with widgets like AnimatedContainer, AnimatedCrossFade, and AnimatedOpacity before moving on to creating custom animations using AnimationController. I’m excited to see how animations will bring my apps to life
